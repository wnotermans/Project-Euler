# Problem 1: multiples of 3 or 5

> Based on https://projecteuler.net/overview=001.

The sum of multiples of 3 or 5 less than 1000 is $3+5+6+9+10+\cdots+999$. While this is not much of a problem for small upper limits, taking an upper limit in the millions or billions could prove to be a little slow when using a program that iterates over every number. Let us therefore split up the sums using the observation that the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 is the same as adding the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 separately and then subtracting the multiples of 15, as they are counted twice.

The sum of multiples of 3 is $3+6+\cdots+999=3(1+2+\cdots+333)$. Similarly, the multiples of 5 add up to $5(1+2+\cdots+199)$. For 15, we get $15(1+2+\cdots+$ `upper_limit//15`$)$, where `//` indicates integer division. 

We note that all of these expressions have the same structure, which is 

> `divisor`$*$(sum of natural numbers up to `upper_limit//divisor`). 

The sum of all natural numbers up to a certain $n$ can be expressed as:[^1] $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}k=\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$
Implementing these observations gives us our final program.
