# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

> Based on https://projecteuler.net/overview=002.

The "brute force" way of calculating this would be to just compute all the Fibonacci numbers up to 4 million, and add up the even ones. Lets see if this can be simplified.

The first thing we note is that every third Fibonacci number is even. We can prove this by induction:

Let $P(3n)$ be the statement that the $(3n)^{th}$ Fibonacci number is even. $P(3)$ holds, because the third Fibonacci number is 2, which is even. Now suppose the statement $P(3n)$ holds, then $$P(3(n+1))=P(3n+3)=P(3n+2)+P(3n+1)$$
$$=P(3n+1)+P(3n)+P(3n+1)=P(3n)+2P(3n+1)$$

$P(3n)$ is even by assumption and $2P(n+1)$ is even because of the factor 2. The sum of even numbers is also even, which means that $P(3(n+1))$ holds.

By the principal of induction, we have now proven that every third Fibonacci number is even. Hence, our program can be adjusted to no longer include a check for evenness, but to just include every third Fibonacci number. Let us check if we can also avoid calculating the odd Fibonacci numbers by rewriting the formula for the Fibonacci sequence:

$$F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)=F(n-2)+F(n-3)+F(n-2)$$
$$=2\big(F(n-3)+F(n-4)\big)+F(n-3)$$
$$=3F(n-3)+F(n-4)+F(n-5)+F(n-6)$$
$$=4F(n-3)+F(n-6)$$

As $F(n-3)$ and $F(n-6)$ are both even Fibonacci numbers, we can now generate all even Fibonacci numbers from the first two: 2 and 8. Implementing this gives our final program.
